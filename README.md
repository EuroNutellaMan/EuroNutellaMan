## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a biotech student at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Firenze (UNIFI) and a political activist with a passion for linux, programming and cybersecurity. I'm mostly self taught and still a beginner programmer.

- I'm currently working on [Boomerizer](https://github.com/EuroNutellaMan/boomerizer), [LorPlot](https://github.com/EuroNutellaMan/LorPlot) and other projects
- I'm learning Rust thanks to the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) and cybersecurity thanks to [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
